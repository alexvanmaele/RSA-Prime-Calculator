RSA Prime Calculator
====================

A small Javascript tool to play with the RSA algorithm and help with decoding it. It is able to calculate considerably large numbers, given the input is valid.


Usage
--------------

1. Download the archive (Download ZIP) and unzip it
2. Open index.html in your web browser
3. Input e and n
4. Press Calculate

Note: The script does not check for valid primes, hence you may experience severe lag if your input is invalid. Always check if the input is actually valid.
